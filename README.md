# My interests!
- Main ones: Art, history, biology, roleplays, worldbuilding, gaming and music.
- You can ask about my fandoms but i don't really interact with fandoms (especially with old ones, when i used to be).

# Before You Interact (BYI)
- You should be <ins> 16 or over </ins> to interact with me, and <ins> 18 or over </ins> to befriend. I don't feel myself comfortable around some minors, please keep in mind that i'm an *adult*.
- Don't push me to talk with you. Please respect my boundaries and i'll respect yours.
- I don't have TD/CD just don't be annoying by booping/kissing me *frequently*.
- Don't joke around me "gay gay homosexual yaoi" jokes, it's just unfunny and annoying :/
- I hide/block freely, but i do it rarely than you may think.
- I freely speak about sensitive topics without TWs and CWs, feel free to ask me put ones if you are uncomfortable.

# Do Not Interact (DNI)
- I don't really have DNI list just don't be a brat without any respect to others.
- Any conversations about ships. I don't understand those battles between pro/dark/com and etc just leave me alone. (I don't support problematic things, remember that)
- Seeking attention. Get a life.
- This one is really specific but... Cookie Run / Roblox fandom.
